  summary:
    "My journey into tech began with a love for math and problem-solving, which led me from [robotics in college to research in AI](/#education) and eventually a career in [data engineering](/#work). Iâ€™ve co-authored a biomedical AI research chapter, published a patent on drone-based geospatial optimization, and [built scalable pipelines at Mediaocean using PySpark, Databricks, and Delta Lake](/#work). Today, I combine my expertise in data engineering with a passion for AI-driven solutions, focusing on building systems that solve real-world problems and deliver measurable impact.",

Working with PySpark, Databricks, Kafka, and Delta Lake, I designed both batch and real-time workflows that transformed raw ad logs into analytics-ready datasets.One highlight was implementing Change Data Capture (CDC) with Redshift, which made incremental data loads faster and more efficient. I also optimized data lakes with the Medallion Architecture, reducing query times and improving reliability for business-critical reporting",
